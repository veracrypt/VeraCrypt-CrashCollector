# When empty, the client's IP address will be taken from $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'].
# Set it to a non empty string to have the client IP be extracted from a request HTTP header.
# Supported values: HTTP_CLIENT_IP, HTTP_FASTLY_CLIENT_IP, HTTP_TRUE_CLIENT_IP, HTTP_X_REAL_IP, HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR
# NB: HTTP_FASTLY_CLIENT_IP is not reliable by default, you have to set up dedicated vcl code for that, see https://www.fastly.com/documentation/reference/http/http-headers/Fastly-Client-IP/
# NB: when setting it to a non empty value, TRUSTED_PROXIES has to be set as well (see below for details).
CLIENT_IP_HEADER=
# Csv list of IP addresses of proxies that you trust to set a truthful header identifying the client ip address.
# This means that the first proxy in the truthful chain _has to_ reset the designated http header if it receives it in

# When a request comes in from an IP which is not in TRUSTED_PROXIES, $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'] will be used as client IP
